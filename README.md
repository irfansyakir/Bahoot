# Kahoot Clone: Web & Android Application

This project is a Kahoot clone featuring a web frontend built using Java with Tomcat, MySQL as the database, and an accompanying Android application developed in Java. The web frontend serves as the primary interface for displaying questions, managing question sets through CRUD operations, and conducting interactive quizzes. The Android application provides live feedback and content based on user interactions with the website. Firebase is utilized to synchronize data between the web and Android platforms.

## Features

1. **Web Frontend**:
    - Display Questions: Showcases questions for quizzes in an interactive manner.
    - CRUD Operations: Enables Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing question sets.
    - Conduct Quizzes: Facilitates conducting interactive quizzes with real-time feedback.
    - Authentication: Provides user authentication for secure access to features.
    - Integration with MySQL: Utilizes MySQL database for storing and retrieving question data.

2. **Android Application**:
    - Live Feedback: Provides live feedback and content based on user interactions with the web frontend.
    - Real-time Updates: Syncs data with the web application using Firebase for seamless integration.
    - Companion App: Acts as a companion to the web frontend, offering a mobile platform for accessing quizzes and receiving feedback.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language used for both web and Android application development.
- **Apache Tomcat**: Used as the servlet container for hosting the Java web application.
- **MySQL**: Database management system employed for storing question data.
- **Firebase**: Utilized for real-time data synchronization between the web and Android platforms.
- **Android Studio**: Integrated development environment used for Android application development.
